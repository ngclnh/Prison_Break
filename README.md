#Prison Break 
Guided Project from Dataquest

What I have learnt from this project:
- Obtain real data from the internet
- Analyze the data in **Python**
- Use **Jupyter Notebook**

The project used data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes to answer the question:
'In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?'
